  <h3>About Myself</h3>
  <p>Hello reader! As good manners indicate, l'll introduce myself before anything else. My name is Pawan and I'm a geek! I love everything related to 
  software development. I love to try new languages, frameworks, tools or any other related technology. I really enjoy reading IT books and sharing things that
  I learn with my fellow colleagues. I try to be a gamer, but with many things to do is getting more an more difficult for me, but I really enjoy building my 
  own gaming rig and keeping it up-to-date, even if I can barely use it. On the academic/professional side of things, I'm a computer engineer working to get job in IBM 
  as an application architect and application developer.</p>
 

<P>That's enough talking about myself! Now I'll try to answer the obvious question: why am I writing another IT blog? With so many great blogs around the web 
is easy to think that writing a new blog is a waste of time. But personally I think that sharing what's on your mind - even if you think it may be useless or 
non important - can be of help to other people.</p>
 

<p>So in this blog, I'll post my thoughts related to software development. I'll share experiences that I've had while working in different languages and 
environments. You can expect content related to programming languages like Java, RPG ILE (I really enjoyed working with RPG for around 6 years), C#, Python,
 JavaScript, PHP an many others. Also, I'll post about development methodologies, sofware architecture, tutorials, guidelines, lessons learned...</p>

 
<p>Please keep in mind that spanish is my native language, so if you happen to find (which you certainly will) any grammatical horror, please let me know! 
This will help me a lot to improve my english writing skills.

 
Last but not least, keep in mind this is a personal blog, anything that you read in this blog only reflects the point of view of the author and does not reflect the opinion of any company, organization, human being, software entity, or any other thing that can be related to me.
 

I hope this blog can be useful for you! Your comments will be appreciated! </p>
